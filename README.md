# Traveler Trip Dataset Analysis
This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing the [Traveler Trip Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/traveler-trip-data) on kaggle.

# Features

# Overview
Travel dataset has trip details like destination, dates, duration, traveler info (name, age, gender, nationality), accommodation and transportation type and cost. It helps in understanding travel patterns and preferences of travelers. Useful for travel agencies to create personalized marketing strategies and packages for different travelers.

# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze the Traveler Trip dataset and gain insights about the travel patterns and preferences of travelers. The dataset contains information about the trips taken by travelers, including their origin, destination, travel date, and other details such as the mode of transportation & accommodation type.


# Requirements
To run the code in this repository, I used the following:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file

# Questions
In this analysis, we will be answering the following questions:

1. What is the most popular destination among travelers?
2. What is the most popular accommodation type among travelers?
3. What are the most popular transportation type among travelers?

***While doing the analysis I will take preference of gender in to consideration.***

# Conclusion
*In conclusion, our analysis of the traveler trip dataset using Python has provided valuable insights into the travel patterns and preferences of genders. The results of our analysis suggest that males and females have different travel behaviors when it comes to destination, transportation mode, and accommodation type. By identifying these differences, travel businesses and policymakers can make informed decisions to provide better travel experiences and improve the overall tourism industry.*
